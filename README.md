# Hashing
Hashing algorithm that places words in a database at a specific index based on reminder of word's ASCI code divided by a number of elements. If the index is occupied, algorithm chains words in a list.

When I was writing this code I found out that there was a problem with multiple inheritance known as the diamond problem. That was not a big issue and virtual inheritance solved the problem. 

File database.txt gives a visual clue how database looks.
